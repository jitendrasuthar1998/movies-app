I want to add a feature by which user can select his favorite movie.

For that, i will have to save some movie related data.

1. movie id
2. movie name

in redux, i will have to create a movies slice.

movies slice initialState will be an empty array.

when user clicks on heart icon on any movie, that time pass that movie id and name to redux store, and save it as movie object in movies array.

after saving movie object data into movies array, get all movies list from favorite and check if the current movie is favorite movie or not.

if it is favorite movie, that time height list heart icon.
